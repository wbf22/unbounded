# Unbounded
Hello and welcome!

This repo contains the Unbounded no code website creator. The entire app is actually contained in Unbounded.html for ease of use.
You can download that html file to edit html files offline, or visit https://wbf22.github.io/unbounded/ to use the editor there.

Unbounded is free to use and the code is in the public domain. If you'd like to support me, here's my link [https://github.com/sponsors/wbf22](https://github.com/sponsors/wbf22)

## Usage
To use Unbounded visit this link [https://wbf22.github.io/unbounded/Unbounded.html](https://wbf22.github.io/unbounded/Unbounded.html)

Unbounded has one main window for the site you're creating, and a few side panels on the right

### Components
This page has a few premade components (website pieces) that you can add to your page. To do so, click on a section of the page, and then click on the plus button on the component.

As you go along, you can create your own components and add them there. (Right click the component on the page and select 'save as component')
You can import or export your components to share them with other people!

### Edit
This is the main tab were you can edit your page with. Websites are made up of lots of pieces called 'elements'. When you click on something in the website view, you'll notice dashed lines around your target. This is the element you have selected. If you select and element this way, and then go to the CSS tab, you can then modify the style of the element.

On the CSS tab I've ordered things in order of what you'd probably most commonly use. Some of the most important sections are layout and sizing. Layout if mostly used for controlling how things are aligned or centered on the page. 'flex' is probably the most common layout type (option for 'display'). Sizing is for controlling the size of the element. HTML has some defaults for how things are sized. If you don't set the width or height for an element, HTML will size it correctly a lot of the time.

Spacing is another important tab used for adding room around an element (margin), or adding spacing between the edge of the element and it's internal contents (padding). 

Text is another important tab used for changing the font size, font, or color of text.

I haven't made a tutorial yet for using Unbounded but I probably should. Hopefully I get to that soon!

### Layout
The layout tab shows how your page is structured. HTML pages work by putting elements inside other elements. This is used in scenarios where you might put paragraphs inside a section, or buttons inside a nav bar. This tab is mostly useful for understanding the structure of your page.

## Design
I made unbounded with these priorities
- create a website page without code
- editor generates html files
- editor focuses on CSS properties

It seems like there's not many website editors that produce html files (at least for free), and this seems like a really nice feature. With many websites editors you're kind of locked in to their platform after creating your website. 

I designed Unbounded to focus on CSS properties so that you would have the most control possible when creating your webpage. Many editors operate on a layer above CSS, or translate their styles into CSS. This can make things easier but can also make it very difficult to correct strange behavior or create something specific. So I thought that having that control would be important. However this does mean Unbounded could have more of a learning curve compared to other editors.

Currently Unbounded does not provide a way to host your webpages or provide any ways to generate javascript. This means you can't use Unbounded to create pages with buttons that do anything other than jump to links, and you can't save or store user data without doing some manually javascript coding yourself. However, if you're willing to get your hands dirty (and do some js coding), or you have a developer to work with, you'll be able to create working websites with these features.

I may in the future set up something for hosting websites you create on Unbounded. So far we haven't made that yet though.


## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, feel free to make a pull request and we can determine if we want to merge that in or make a fork instead.
If you'd like to make a fork I'm totally fine with that, and if it's pretty good, we'll link to it here.


## Other
This repo also contains a paint app similar to MS paint. It's still a work in progress but can be accessed here [https://wbf22.github.io/unbounded/Monet.html](https://wbf22.github.io/unbounded/Monet.html)
